<H1>INTRODUCTION</H1>
Toy problems contains three challenges which are Student grade generator, Speed Detector and Net salary calculator.Javascript will be used to wire down the solutions.

<h2>CHALLENGES</h2>
 STUDENT GRADE GENERATOR
<P>This is the first challenge whereby we write the function that prompths the user to input student marks.The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should then correspond to the correct grade like as follows;</P>

<p> - B - 60 to 79</p>
<p> - C - 59 to 49</p>
<p> - D - 40 to 49</p>
<p> - E - less 40</p>


SPEED DETECTOR
<p>This is the second challenge whereby you write a program that inputs the speed of the car and then it outputs 'OK' if the speed limit is below 70 and outputs the total number of demerit points if the car is driven for every 5 km/s above the speed limit.</p> 

NET SALARY CALCULATOR
<p>In this last challenge you write a program that calculate's an individuals net salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Hence you should calculate the payee, NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, gross salary and net salary.</p>

<p>1. Click the FORK icon in the upper right of this page. This will bring you to GitHub. If you are prompted to choose where to fork, choose your personal GitHub account.</p>
<p>2. Once your fork is created, click the Code button in GitHub, make sure SSH is selected, and copy the provided git URL info.</p>
Then in your terminal:
<p>3. Make sure you're in Development/code (or wherever you're storing your code for the course) and clone the repo to your local machine with git clone followed by the git URL you copied.</p>

```$ git clone git@github.com:mary-ruguru/phase-1/Toy-problems.git```
<p>3. The previous command will create a folder in the location you're currently in containing your fork of this lab's repository. cd into the repository that you just cloned down in the terminal, then run code . to open the files in Visual Studio Code.</p>

```$ cd phase-1-Toy-problems.git```

```$ code .```
<p>4. All the codes will  be written in javasript</p>

<h4> RUNNING THE TEST</h4>
<p> In your terminal run </p>
```$ npm install```
<p> Then run ```$ npm test``` to see the current status of the tests in the terminal. For the moment, all of the tests fail</p>
<p> After passing all the tests , you can run ```$ git add .``` , then ```$ git commit -m ""``` to add a  commit then ```$ git push``` to push the project to the github.
